**Basketball Data Analytics**: As part of Duke's <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/basketball-analytics-pipeline-raw-video-dynamic-visualization">2019 Data+ Program</a>, I spent 10 weeks extracting basketball player motion data from basketball footage found on YouTube using a neural network, as well as training machine learning models to distinguish referees from players and group the detected players onto teams. You can check out our <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/basketball-analytics">code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/files/Basketball Poster.pdf">poster</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/files/Basketball Summary Slides.pdf">slides</a> from our end-of-summer presentation.
