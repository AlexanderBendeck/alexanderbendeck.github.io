**GPT-4V's Visualization Literacy**: Multimodal LLMs are here. We can now ask models like GPT to answer questions about images, including data visualizations â€” but  how good are they at answering these questions? In this work, I evaluated the GPT-4V model on a suite of visualization literacy tasks to characterize the strengths and weaknesses of the model at reading charts. I presented this work as a [paper at IEEE VIS 2024](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~john.stasko/papers/vis24-llm.pdf).

**Robin (U.S. Migration)**: Internal migration within the United States has the potential to reshape the country socially and politically. Past research has found that people are more likely to migrate within the U.S. to counties that match their current county in factors including political orientation, median income, and more. I built an interactive map tool, [Robin](https://alexanderbendeck.shinyapps.io/robin-migration/), to help users explore these county-level migration patterns. Robin will be presented at [HICSS 2025](https://hicss.hawaii.edu/).

**SlopeSeeker**: SlopeSeeker is a system which I built during my internship at Tableau Research in Summer 2023. It is a search tool for exploring a dataset of temporal data using trend search queries in natural language, such as "show me stocks that were tanking". The interface supports faceted search for users to navigate a semantic hierarchy of trend concepts. SlopeSeeker was [published at IUI 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3640543.3645208).
