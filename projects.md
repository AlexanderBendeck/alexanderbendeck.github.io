**Panda**: Panda is a weakly-supervised system for entity matching. Panda uses the *labeling function* abstraction, where labeling functions (LFs) are user-provided programs that can cheaply generate many noisy match/unmatch labels. These LFs can then be combined by a labeling model to make accurate final predictions. I am currently working on improving the <a href="http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2735-wu.pdf">preliminary Panda system</a> to more intelligently combine LFs and scale better on massive datasets.

**More coming soon!**

**I-Rex**: I-Rex, an Interactive Relational Query Explainer for SQL, is a tool meant to help students learning SQL understand their mistakes while debugging incorrect queries. Check out <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p2997-miao.pdf">the paper</a> or watch the <a href="https://dukedb-hnrq.github.io/#demo-video">VLDB demo video</a> (starring yours truly). I-Rex has now been utilized by students in the introductory database course at Duke for several semesters. This work is part of a broader project <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2008107">funded by NSF</a> called "HNRQ: Helping Novices Learn and Debug Relational Queries".

**NeuroFit**: This is an interdisciplinary research study in the <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">MCAB Lab</a> at Duke. Participants in this study have their physical activity monitored for three months while receiving physical activity promotion messages on their phones in the form of text messages. I analyzed partial data results to investigate the effectiveness of these text messages at motivating participants to be more physically active. You can read my report about the results <a href="https://alexanderbendeck.github.io/files/NeuroFit Report.pdf">here</a>. Feel free to read more about the study and check out some of the code <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/neurofit-study">on GitHub</a>.

**Basketball Data Analytics**: As part of Duke's <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/basketball-analytics-pipeline-raw-video-dynamic-visualization">2019 Data+ Program</a>, I spent 10 weeks extracting basketball player motion data from basketball footage found on YouTube using a neural network, as well as training machine learning models to distinguish referees from players and group the detected players onto teams. If you're curious, you can explore our <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/basketball-analytics">code</a>, <a href="https://alexanderbendeck.github.io/files/Basketball Poster.pdf">poster</a>, and <a href="https://alexanderbendeck.github.io/files/Basketball Summary Slides.pdf">slides</a> from our end-of-summer presentation.
