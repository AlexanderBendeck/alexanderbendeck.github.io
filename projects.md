**Basketball Data Analytics**: As part of Duke's <a href="https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/basketball-analytics-pipeline-raw-video-dynamic-visualization">2019 Data+ Program</a>, I spent 10 weeks extracting basketball player motion data from basketball footage found on YouTube using a neural network, as well as training machine learning models to distinguish referees from players and group the detected players onto teams. You can check out our <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/basketball-analytics">code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/files/Basketball Poster.pdf">poster</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderBendeck/files/Basketball Summary Slides.pdf">slides</a> from our end-of-summer presentation.

**Python Quiz Web App**: For a course project, some friends and I made a web application to help students in Duke's introductory computer science course study for exams. We constructed a database with hundreds of quiz questions and deployed a quiz app in the classroom, where it got great reviews. The app is now in the capable hands of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshul-shah99">Anshul</a>, who has greatly improved it over the past year. Unfortunately, the app is only visible to those with Duke credentials, but you can see a demo video <a href="https://youtu.be/3g_aXmRYzzo?t=334">here</a>.
