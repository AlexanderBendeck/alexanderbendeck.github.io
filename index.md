# About

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, advised on an interim basis by Prof. [Xu Chu](https://chu-data-lab.cc.gatech.edu/). I have broad interests in databases, data management, machine learning, and interactive data analytics.

I completed my undergrad at Duke University. I worked with professors [Jun Yang](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/) and [Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/) on database projects such as [HNRQ](https://dukedb-hnrq.github.io/). I was also engaged in interdisciplinary research through the [Bass Connections program](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/using-neuroscience-optimize-digital-health-interventions-across-adulthood-2019-2020) at Duke. I worked in the [MCAB Lab](https://www.mcablab.science/) under the supervision of professor [Gregory Samanez-Larkin](https://www.mcablab.science/gregoryrsl).
