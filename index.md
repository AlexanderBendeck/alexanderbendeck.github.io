# About

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. [John Stasko](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/stasko/). I have broad interests in data visualization and visual analytics, especially for geographic data, and I am currently studying how to use text and large language models to support user interaction with data. I am also working on building visualization tools to support electric grid operators (in collaboration with Sandia National Labs).

I completed my undergrad at Duke University. I worked with professors [Jun Yang](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/) and [Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/) on database projects such as [HNRQ](https://dukedb-hnrq.github.io/). I was also engaged in interdisciplinary research through the [Bass Connections program](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/using-neuroscience-optimize-digital-health-interventions-across-adulthood-2019-2020) at Duke. I worked in the [MCAB Lab](https://www.mcablab.science/) under the supervision of professor [Gregory Samanez-Larkin](https://www.mcablab.science/gregoryrsl).
