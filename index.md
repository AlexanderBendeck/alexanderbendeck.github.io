# About

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. [John Stasko](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/stasko/). I am currently studying how **large language models can support visual data analysis**. I also have broad interests in data visualization and visual analytics, especially for geographic data. Previously, I worked with collaborators at Sanida National Labs on designing visualizations to support electric grid operators.

Before Georgia Tech, I attended Duke University as an undergraduate student. I worked with professors [Jun Yang](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/) and [Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/) on database projects such as [HNRQ](https://dukedb-hnrq.github.io/). I was also engaged in interdisciplinary research through the [Bass Connections program](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project/using-neuroscience-optimize-digital-health-interventions-across-adulthood-2019-2020/) at Duke. I worked in the [MCAB Lab](https://www.mcablab.science/) under the supervision of professor [Gregory Samanez-Larkin](https://www.mcablab.science/gregoryrsl).
