# About

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Duke University, pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science with a second major in Statistical Science. I have broad interests in databases, data management, machine learning, and computational statistics.

Recently, I have been working with professors [Jun Yang](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/) and [Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/) on database projects such as [I-Rex](http://www.miaozhengjie.com/irex/). I am also engaged in interdisciplinary research through the [Bass Connections program ](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/using-neuroscience-optimize-digital-health-interventions-across-adulthood-2019-2020) at Duke; I work in the [MCAB Lab](https://www.mcablab.science/) under the supervision of professor [Gregory Samanez-Larkin](https://www.mcablab.science/gregoryrsl).
